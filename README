README for TAP-Harness-Multiple

This distribution includes packages for extending the functionality of the
TAP::Harness and TAP::Harness::Archive distributions from CPAN.

You should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
